Part B
	This part of pgp takes cryptics (ce_inclusion and ce_extension), skiptics (exon_skip) and IR events lists (in csv format) and generates AA (and other files) fasta files for each event type.
	Please note that for ce_inclusion events list, we use different cutoffs to make sure all events in this list are counted as ce_inclusion events. In some cases we might need to perform new coverage calculations for an event for which this was not already done in Part A of the pipeline (this usually happen when new events are added in this list)
	All AA fasta files (one for each of the event type) are merged to a single AA fasta (and other files) as explained below. This step is must to generate PEAKS compatible AA fast file and other files for backmapping algorithm.

CONCATENATION OF AA fasta FiLES FROM ALL EVENT TYPES

HERE WE PERFOMRED TWO ROUNDS (for other data sets we might have to perform more rounds of cov_cutoff to include all events in ce_inclusion) OF cov_cutoff FOR pgp (Part A) GUIDED CE_INCLUSION EVENTS FOR 40% and 15% CUTOFF
STEP1: CONCATENATE ce_inclusion files generated by 40% FOLLOWED by 15% cut off
1. nt files (cds_ce_inclusion_fused.transeq_in.fasta etc) into cds_merged_nt_inclusion.fasta file
2. AA fasta files (cds_PEAKS_CE_INCLUSION_FUSED_AA.fasta) into cds_PEAKS_merged_aa_inclusion.fasta file
3. cds_IGV_unique_ce_inclusion.csv files from 40% and 15% cutoff to cds_merged_igv_inclusion.csv

STEP2: NOW CONCATENATE 

1. cds_merged_nt_inclusion.fasta file and nt file (cds_ce_extension_fused.transeq_in.fasta) from extension events into cds_merged_nt_ce.fasta
2. cds_PEAKS_merged_aa_inclusion.fasta file and cds_PEAKS_CE_EXTENSION_FUSED_AA.fasta file from extension events into cds_PEAKS_aa_ce.fasta
3. cds_merged_igv_inclusion.csv file and cds_IGV_unique_ce_extension.csv file into cds_merged_igv_ce.csv

STEP3: NOW CONCATENATE

1. cds_PEAKS_aa_ce.fasta, cds_PEAKS_SKIPTICS_FUSED_AA.fasta and FINAL_IR_AA.fasta files into PEAKS_AA.fasta
IMPORTANT NOTE: We need individual merged_nt_ce.fasta, nt fasta file for SKIPTICS and IR events as well as merged_aa_ce.fasta, IR_AA.fasta files alongside respective csv files for proper backmapping on PEAKS search results.
