# proteogenomic-pipeline
This repository comprises of three pipelines for biomarker discovery project. Each pipeline make use of a combination of bash (and R) scripts to accomplish specific task.

1. RNA-seq analysis pipeline	
	This pipeline performs typical rna-seq analysis steps including 1) merging fastq files (from different lanes and forward/reverse reads), 2) trimming of fastq files, 3) quality control (fastq), 4) STAR index creation and 5) STAR alignment.
2. Differential expression analysis
	This pipeline performs differential gene analysis by 1) generating gene and transcript abundance file for each sample 

3. proteogenomic-pipeline
